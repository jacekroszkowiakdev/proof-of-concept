# proof-of-concept

A POC (Proof of Concept) for connecting a database (DB) and an API through Node.js typically means creating a small, functional prototype to demonstrate how the connection between the database and the API can work. This is not a fully-fledged application but rather a minimal implementation to validate the feasibility of the integration.
What your Jira item means:

Youâ€™re tasked with:

    Database Connection: Establishing a connection to a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) using Node.js.
    API Creation: Setting up an API endpoint (e.g., REST or GraphQL) that interacts with the database.
    Integration: Demonstrating that the API can perform operations like:
        Fetching data from the database.
        Inserting data into the database.
        Updating or deleting records in the database.
    Validation: Ensuring the connection and API interaction works correctly by testing it
